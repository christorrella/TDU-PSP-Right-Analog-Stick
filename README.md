# Compatibility

Currently this cheat is only compatible with the USA region version of the game (ULUS10249). 

If there's enough requests from the community to port it to other regions, I may do so.

This cheat has only been tested with PPSSPP. It has not been tested on a PS Vita. 

# Installation

1. Copy the ULUS10249.ini file into the "Cheats" directory for PPSSPP  (or copy its contents into an existing ULUS10249.ini file)
2. Enable Cheats in PPSSPP's System Settings
3. Enable the cheat in the PPSSPP pause menu under "Cheats" while the game is running

# In-Game Usage

## Configuration

Within PPSSPP's Control Mapping settings, map the Right Analog Stick (RightAn.Up/Down/Left/Right) to whatever input method you're using. (This is required!)

## Control the Camera

Use the input method you configured for PPSSPP as the Right Analog Stick to control the camera
